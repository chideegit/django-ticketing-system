## Description

A ticketing system improves your customers experiece while using your service or product. Not only your customers but internal users as well. With the ticketing system, one can attend to issues in real time, see tickets on queue, assign to different engineers and make your customers/internal users feel confident in your I.T operations and customer-centric system. This particular project was setup with easy-to-use features, which emulates the basics of a ticketing system - which is ease!

## Features

Here are what makes the project tick! Please go through the features to see why this project is awesome!

- Simple Dashboard
    - This is the landing page for all authenticated users. However, users would be directed to the login page when they are not authenticated.
    - You can add customizations to change the looks of the dashboard to suit your taste.
- Multiple User Types
    - Due to the nature of the project, it's only right that it carries a MUT, for better role, rights and privilege checks.
- Automatic Ticket Status Update
    - Updates on tickets' status are done automatically as the ticket moves through its lifecycle. Any user can see this happen in real time. 
- Superusers can assign ticket to any engineer
    - There's a ticket queue that can only be accessd by superusers. From this queue, tickets can be assigned to engineers (maybe based on priority or skillset. It's up to you to decide)

2. Create Engineers (from the admin panel), and make sure to check the 'is_engineer' box, so that the user can have all the roles and priviledges of an engineer. 
3. From the [Register Page](http://127.0.0.1:8000/register-customer), you can register a test customer and log in. 
4. Once logged in as a customer, you can create and manage your tickets. 
5. After a ticket has been created, view the experience from an engineer's scope by logging into the site as an engineer.
